Problem 10 - query to validate information - authors that don't have any books aren't showed here,
but you can check the information about the rest of them.
Note, that the task is to show all authors
with their total number of copies which includes the authors without books.


SELECT sum(b.copies), concat(a.first_name, " ", a.last_name)
FROM books as b
JOIN authors a on b.author_id = a.id
GROUP BY author_id
ORDER BY sum(b.copies) DESC;
